# AutoGenescan
Automated CAG calling pipeline for HTT genescan data. Uses the excellent Fragman package to detect peaks (Giovanny Covarrubias-Pazaran et al. 2016, BMC Genetics 17: 62). These peaks are then used to caculate graphs, modal CAG lengths and various instability/expansion indicies for downstream analyses.

See the associated .docx file for instructions on how to use the script.

Changelog
v1.5
Added an additional output graph without any marked peaks for presenations/publication.
